# üîß Troubleshooting Universal Links - Why It's Not Working

## üêõ Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue #1: iOS Caches the Old AASA File (MOST COMMON!)

**Problem:** iOS downloads and caches the AASA file when the app is first installed. Even after we fix the file on the server, iOS still uses the old cached version.

**Solution - MUST DO THESE STEPS:**

1. **Delete the app completely from iPhone**
   ```
   Long press app icon ‚Üí Remove App ‚Üí Delete App
   ```

2. **Clear Safari cache**
   ```
   Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Clear History and Website Data
   ```

3. **Restart iPhone**
   ```
   Power off and power on
   ```

4. **Reinstall the app**
   ```
   Download fresh from App Store/TestFlight
   ```

5. **Wait 30 seconds** before testing
   - iOS needs time to download the AASA file from the server

### Issue #2: Content-Type Header (CURRENTLY AN ISSUE!)

**Problem:** Cloudflare is serving the file with wrong Content-Type

**Current Status:**
- ‚ùå Being served as: `application/octet-stream`
- ‚úÖ Should be: `application/json`

**Why this matters:** iOS might reject the file if Content-Type is wrong.

**Solution:** Need to configure Cloudflare Pages correctly (working on this)

### Issue #3: Testing Method

**WRONG WAY TO TEST:**
‚ùå Opening link in Safari and tapping
‚ùå Copy-paste URL in Notes app
‚ùå Testing immediately after app install

**RIGHT WAY TO TEST:**

1. **Method 1: Messages App**
   ```
   - Send yourself a message with link: https://getborderless.space/packages/test
   - Tap the link in Messages
   - Should open app directly (if working)
   ```

2. **Method 2: Safari + Long Press**
   ```
   - Go to website in Safari
   - Long press a link
   - Should see "Open in [App Name]" option
   ```

3. **Method 3: Notes App (Second Tap)**
   ```
   - Paste link in Notes
   - Tap once (might open Safari)
   - Go back to Notes
   - Tap again (should open app)
   ```

### Issue #4: Domain Mismatch

**Problem:** App is registered for wrong domain

**Check:**
- ‚úÖ AASA file at: `https://getborderless.space/.well-known/apple-app-site-association`
- ‚úÖ App bundle: `66ZD8Z6QR8.com.aitechlab.esim`
- ‚úÖ Domain in Xcode: Must be `getborderless.space` (NOT `www.getborderless.space`)

**Where to check in Xcode:**
```
Target ‚Üí Signing & Capabilities ‚Üí Associated Domains
Should have: applinks:getborderless.space
```

### Issue #5: App Not in Production

**Problem:** Universal Links only work for apps distributed via:
- ‚úÖ App Store
- ‚úÖ TestFlight
- ‚ùå NOT Xcode direct install

**Solution:** Make sure testing with TestFlight or App Store build

### Issue #6: URL Pattern Mismatch

**Current patterns in AASA:**
```
/packages/*  - Opens package details
/esim/*      - Opens eSIM details
/support/*   - Opens support
/referral/*  - Applies referral
```

**Test URLs that SHOULD work:**
```
https://getborderless.space/packages/123
https://getborderless.space/esim/abc
https://getborderless.space/support/ticket
https://getborderless.space/referral/CODE
```

**URLs that WON'T work:**
```
https://getborderless.space/  (homepage - not in patterns)
https://getborderless.space/blog/  (not in patterns)
https://getborderless.space/random  (not in patterns)
```

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step Testing Guide

### For Developer (Orkhan/Shamxal):

**Step 1: Verify AASA File**
```bash
curl https://getborderless.space/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
```

Should return JSON with your app ID: `66ZD8Z6QR8.com.aitechlab.esim`

**Step 2: Check Xcode Configuration**

1. Open Xcode project
2. Select app target
3. Go to "Signing & Capabilities"
4. Find "Associated Domains"
5. Should have: `applinks:getborderless.space`

**Step 3: Clean Install**

1. Delete app from device
2. Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Clear History and Website Data
3. Restart device
4. Install fresh from TestFlight/App Store
5. Wait 30 seconds

**Step 4: Test in Messages**

1. Open Messages
2. Send yourself: `https://getborderless.space/packages/test123`
3. Tap the link
4. Should open app!

**Step 5: Check iOS Logs (If Still Not Working)**

1. Connect iPhone to Mac
2. Open Console app on Mac
3. Filter for: "swcd"
4. Test the link
5. Look for errors about AASA file

## üîç Debugging Commands

### Check if iOS downloaded the AASA file:
```bash
# On Mac with iPhone connected
# Open Console app ‚Üí Filter: "swcd"
# Look for: "Successfully downloaded"
```

### Verify file is accessible:
```bash
curl -I https://getborderless.space/.well-known/apple-app-site-association
```

Should show:
- `HTTP/2 200` ‚úÖ
- `content-type: application/json` ‚ùå (currently wrong!)

### Verify JSON is valid:
```bash
curl https://getborderless.space/.well-known/apple-app-site-association | python3 -m json.tool
```

Should print formatted JSON without errors.

## üéØ Most Likely Issue

Based on testing in Safari/Notes not working, the problem is likely:

1. **iOS cache** - Old AASA file is cached
   - **Solution:** Delete app, clear Safari, restart, reinstall

2. **Wrong testing method** - Safari/Notes don't always trigger Universal Links on first tap
   - **Solution:** Use Messages app or long-press in Safari

3. **Content-Type header** - File served with wrong MIME type
   - **Solution:** We're working on fixing this

## üìù Tell Your Dev Team

**Do this first (99% chance this fixes it):**

1. Delete app completely
2. Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Clear History and Website Data
3. Restart iPhone
4. Reinstall app from TestFlight
5. Wait 30 seconds
6. Test in Messages app (send link to yourself)

**If still not working:**

Check Xcode Associated Domains:
- Must have: `applinks:getborderless.space`
- NOT: `applinks:www.getborderless.space`
- NOT: `applinks:*.getborderless.space`

## üÜò Need More Help?

Send us:
1. Screenshot of Xcode ‚Üí Associated Domains
2. iOS Console logs (search for "swcd")
3. Exact URL being tested
4. How the link is being opened (Safari, Messages, Notes?)

---

**TL;DR:** Delete app, clear Safari cache, restart phone, reinstall app, test in Messages app (not Safari/Notes).
